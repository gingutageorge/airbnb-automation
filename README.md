# Airbnb Test Automation Project

This project automates search and validation scenarios on Airbnb using Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber.js, and TypeScript. The main goal is to validate specific aspects of Airbnb property search results, such as filtering properties by location, guest capacity, and other amenities, and verifying that the details match between search results and the detailed property pages.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  - **features/**: Contains the Cucumber feature files describing the behavior-driven test scenarios in plain language.
  - **step_definitions/**: Holds the step definition files where the actual test automation logic (interaction with the Airbnb site) is implemented.
  - **pages/**: Page Object Model (POM) classes representing different pages and elements on Airbnb (e.g., home page, property details page).

## Prerequisites

- **npm** (v6.x or later)

**Reporting**

Unfortunately I am not fully satisfied with the result, it could have been much more complete given more time.
